# Render props example

After watching [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcVAq3YFiuc&t=6s) about 3 ways of code reuse in React: minxins, HoC and renderProps and why renderProps is the best of them -> I want to do an example to try out using renderProps in order to apply to real projects further. On the other hand, I want to compare code base of 3 solutions when apply them to a specific problem.
